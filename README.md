# SnakeGame-RL
This simple Single Agent Reinforcement Learning Snake Game is coded in Python. GUI uses a pygame library. Talking about the game, it’s a single player game, where the player (Snake) has to eat all the apples in order to grow longer. The prime objective of the game is to maximize the score. While playing the game, if the snake crosses the edges, it will die. After eating an apple, the snake’s length increases by a unit value and score increases. In this project, the model trains on its own where the agent aims towards collecting more rewards and sustaining in the environment.
